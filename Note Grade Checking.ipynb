    "You are part of a team working to make mobile payments available globally, and are asked to build a deep learning model to detect fraud--whenever someone makes a payment, you want to see if the payment might be fraudulent, such as if the user's account has been taken over by a hacker. \n",
    "\n",
    "But backpropagation is quite challenging to implement, and sometimes has bugs. Because this is a mission-critical application, your company's CEO wants to be really certain that your implementation of backpropagation is correct. Your CEO says, \"Give me a proof that your backpropagation is actually working!\" To give this reassurance, you are going to use \"gradient checking\".\n",

    "## 1) How does gradient checking work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation computes the gradients $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta}$, where $\\theta$ denotes the parameters of the model. $J$ is computed using forward propagation and your loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because forward propagation is relatively easy to implement, you're confident you got that right, and so you're almost  100% sure that you're computing the cost $J$ correctly. Thus, you can use your code for computing $J$ to verify the code for computing $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look back at the definition of a derivative (or gradient):\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta} = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\frac{J(\\theta + \\varepsilon) - J(\\theta - \\varepsilon)}{2 \\varepsilon} \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with the \"$\\displaystyle \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0}$\" notation, it's just a way of saying \"when $\\varepsilon$ is really really small.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We know the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta}$ is what you want to make sure you're computing correctly. \n",
    "- You can compute $J(\\theta + \\varepsilon)$ and $J(\\theta - \\varepsilon)$ (in the case that $\\theta$ is a real number), since you're confident your implementation for $J$ is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets use equation (1) and a small value for $\\varepsilon$ to convince your CEO that your code for computing  $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta}$ is correct!"
